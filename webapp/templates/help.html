      <p>Competitive programming is a mind sport where competitors try to solve a variety of algorithmic problems using various different techniques in computer science and mathematics, such as dynamic programming, graphs, number theory, data structures and geometry.</p>
      <p>The biggest competitive programming website in the world, where there are regular weekly competitions and an array of many problems, is <a href="https://codeforces.com/">codeforces</a>.</p>
      <p>In codeforces there are users, each of which is attributed a rating based on their performance on contests. There are also problems, each of which contains a rating that represents its difficulty as well as a set of tags that represent the general group of techniques that problem falls into. There are also the contests which are a grouping of problems which everyone can register and compete trying to solve the problems in a timed interval, usually 2 hours.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In our application we tried to crunch the data generated by those thousands of users and problems and return them in a nicer way. In the following paragraphs I will give brief descriptions of each functionality</p>
      <p>User finder: As the name suggests it is simply a way to find a user based on the given parameters, such as rating and institution or country</p>
      <p>Problem finder: Similarly to the user finder, returns a list of problems ordered by the ones that have the most user solutions according to the specified parameters, such as rating and tag</p>
      <p>Contest Graph: Returns a graph visualizing data such as difficulty of number of solutions of a contest in a given range of indexes. The indexes of the contest are ordered chronologically</p>
      <p>Tags graph: Returns a graph represting the number of problems along each possible rating for each of the selected tags</p>
      <p>Tags intersection: Returns the number of problems in the given rating range that contain ALL of the selected tags (that's why it's called 'tags intersection') in the selected format (table, graph or total).</p>
