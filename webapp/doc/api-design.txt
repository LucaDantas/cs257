GET parameters
    search_type (Required) -- defines whether we should search users
        by their institution or country

    search_name (Required) -- gives the name of the institution/country
        to search for
    
    lowest_rating (Optional, default: -infinity) -- return only users with
        rating bigger than or equal to the one given
    
    highest_rating (Optional, default: infinity) -- return only users with
        rating less than or equal to the one given

    max_users (Optional, default: 10) -- the maximum number of users to return
        if value given is higher than 500 it is changed to 500

RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each of which represents one
user, sorted decreasingly by rating. Each dictionary in this list
will have the following fields.

   handle -- (TEXT) the user's handle
   name -- (TEXT) the user's name
   rating -- (INTEGER) the user's current rating
   max_rating -- (INTEGER) the user's maximum rating
   rank -- (TEXT) the user's current rank
   max_rank -- (TEXT) the user's maximum rank

EXAMPLE:
    /authors?search_type=institution&search_name="Carleton College"&lowest_rating=400&max_users=5

       [{"handle":"Luca", "name":"Luca", "rating":2268, "max_rating":2268, "rank":"Master", "max_rank":"Master"},
       {"handle":"batmendbar", "name":"Batmend", "rating":1974, "max_rating":1974, "rank":"Candidate Master", "max_rank":"Candidate Master"},
       {"handle":"column", "name":"Zimri", "rating":409, "max_rating":409, "rank":"Newbie", "max_rank":"Newbie"}]



REQUEST: /problems

GET parameters
    tag (Optional, default='') -- returns only problems that contain
        the defined tag. If left blank returns problems of any tag
    
    lowest_rating (Optional, default: -infinity) -- return only problems with
        rating bigger than or equal to the one given
    
    highest_rating (Optional, default: infinity) -- return only problems with
        rating less than or equal to the one given

    max_problems (Optional, default: 10) -- the maximum number of problems to return
        if value given is higher than 500 it is changed to 500

RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each of which represents one
problem, sorted decreasingly by number of users who solved the problem.
Each dictionary in this list will have the following fields.

   id -- (INTEGER) the codeforces id of the problem
   name -- (TEXT) the problem's name
   rating -- (INTEGER) the problem's rating
   tags -- (TEXT) the list of tags of a problem separated by commas
   solved_count -- (INTEGER) the number of users that solved that problem

EXAMPLE:
    /problems?tag='dp'&lowest_rating=2000&highest_rating=2300

       [{"id":1, "name":"Batman plays with number", "rating":2300, "tags":"dp,number theory,graphs", "solved_count":222}]



REQUEST: /contests

GET parameters
    data_requested (Required) -- defines whether to display the graph by difficulty
        of the contest (calculated by the average difficulty of each contest)
        or by the number of users that solved any problem of that contest
    
    lowest_index (Optional, default: 0) -- return only the contests with index
        bigger than or equal to the given value
    
    highest_index (Optional, default: infinity) -- return only the contests with index
        less than or equal to the given value

RESPONSE: a JSON list of tuples of two elements, each of which represents one
contest, sorted increasingly by index. Each tuple contains a pair of (index, difficulty)
if the requested information was difficulty or a pair of (index, solved_count) if the
requested information was solved count

EXAMPLE:
    /contests?data_requested='difficulty'&lowest_index=1700&highest_index=1702

    [(1700, 1850), (1701, 2004), (1702, 1497)]



REQUEST: /tags_graph

GET parameters
    tags (Required) -- returns a plot graph for each of the required
        tags. The input is a list of tags separated by commas

RESPONSE: a JSON list of tuples, each of which represents one
tag, sorted alphabetically by the name of the tag.
Each tuple in this list will have the following fields.

   tag -- (TEXT) the name of the tag
   count -- (INTEGER) the number of problems with that tag

EXAMPLE:
    /tags_graph?tags='dp,number theory,graphs'

       [("dp", 368), ("number theory", 203), ("graphs", 687)]



REQUEST: /tags_intersection

GET parameters
    tags (Required) -- returns the information for the problems that
        contain all tags. The input is a list of tags separated by commas

RESPONSE: a JSON list of dictionaries, each of which represents one
rating range, sorted decreasingly by rating. Each dictionary in this list
will have the following fields.

   rating -- (INTEGER) the beginning of the rating range (all problems ratings' are multiples of 100)
   problem_count -- (INTEGER) the count of problems in that range
      with those tags
   solved_count -- (INTEGER) the count of solutions of problems
      in that range with those tags

EXAMPLE:
    /tags_graph?tags='dp,number theory,graphs'

       [{rating:2200, problem_count:0, solved_count:0}, {rating:2300, problem_count:1, solved_count:222}]
